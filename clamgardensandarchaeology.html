                    <h2> Archaeological Theory </h2>
                    <p class="lead">
As previously mentioned, archaeologists arrived fairly late in the game in terms of their acknowledgment and study of clam gardens. This comes as a surprise due to the sheer size and surface level visibility of these features. However visible, clam gardens are subtle features in terms of their function, causing them to be easily disregard as manmade features. In addition, classic anthropological theory situated Northwest Coast Indigenous peoples as outside the scope of agricultural or maricultural capabilities, thus forestalling archaeologists from accepting clam gardens for what they are when at first observation. Northwest Coast archaeological theory had for some time centred upon notions of social complexity and the idea that hunting,fishing and gathering could not function alongside maricultural practices as it is incompatible with the unilinear trajectory of social complexity. Importantly, clam gardens are not the only example of agricultural or maricultural practices on the Northwest Coast that defy anthropological concepts of social complexity. Below are some examples of such ‘outliers’: </p>

                    <h2>Sea Level History</h2>
                    <p class="lead">
Sea levels have never been a constant feature on the landscape and manifest highly localized expressions on the Northwest Coast as a result of glacial and tectonic processes. For the lifetime of modern humans, sea levels have been relatively stable when compared to the experiences of ancient peoples. The chart below depicts four regions of the coast highlighting their unique local expressions and the extent to which sea levels have changed over the last 10,000 years. Understanding sea level change is important because Indigenous peoples were present on the landscape during these environmental changes and may have recorded such experiences within their oral histories. For example, the Haida oral history ‘Tow Hill Walking’ explains how Tow Hill, a landmark in northern Haida Gwaii, came to reside in that location, possibly reflecting rising sea levels.For more on this, check out this video depiction of the story made by the Haida: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IkEqA6FBg0."> Tow Hill Walking.</a> 
Sea level change has a direct affect upon where a clam garden would have been constructed in the past and where it may be located today. In areas where sea levels were once lower, clam gardens would be hidden completely underwater in the subtidal zone today and require underwater archaeological methods to locate them. By contrast, areas where sea levels were once higher, the remnants of clam gardens may be found inland today.

                    <h2>Dating Clam Gardens</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Archaeological dating methods

As there has been little research done on clam gardens to date, Lepofsky et al. had to develop new techniques to employ radiocarbon dating, in order to date clam gardens. For a basic introduction to these dating methods, check out our glossary page! Using the four regions previously surveyed, the team excavated trenches within six terraced gardens using two techniques: excavating the landward side of the wall and excavating within the wall itself. Excavating the landward side of the wall allowed the team to test shells of clams that had died around the time of construction. These clams were found between the “old beach” (i.e. beach surface before the wall) and shell hash used as infill in the terrace. In addition, this excavation technique revealed radiocarbon datable barnacle scars on rocks at the boundary between the ancient beach and terrace. Within the rock walls, the researchers exposed the deepest buried rocks which formed the foundation of the wall. Barnacle scars on these rocks provide the maximum age of wall construction, whereas samples collected from the top of the wall provide minimum ages. This excavation technique also permitted the researchers to uncover wood debris and other shellfish that had either been trapped during construction or had settled within the wall or in the shell hash around the old beach surface. These organic materials are also dateable. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead"> <img src="http://i347.photobucket.com/albums/p466/sageschmied/media-20170413_zpsjaxy8dmo.png"/> </p>
<p class="lead">These tests, which were the first radiocarbon dates recorded for clam gardens on the coast, yielded a date range of approximately 1700 - 200 years old. The excavations also provide details on wall construction and the placement of walls helps researchers study sea level change. The rock walls were constructed at specific tidal heights to maximize clam productivity. </p>

<p class="lead">Expanding on the archaeological dating of clam gardens, Neudorf, Smith, Lepofsky, Toniello and Lian (hereafter referred to as Neudorf et al.,) were the first to employ OSL dating methods of clam garden in their research published in 2017. To do so, Neudorf et al. sampled three clam garden sites on northern Quadra Island, British Columbia. Their results determined that wall construction at all three sites likely began between approximately 1000 and 1700 years ago. In addition, they found that the construction of clam garden walls increased the amount of sediment in the intertidal zone by fourfold and that the construction of at least one of the sampled walls was built incrementally over time, possibly over the span of multiple generations. These results fall in line with those of Lepofsky et al., indicating that clam gardening traditions date to at least the late Holocene (i.e. 3500 years ago).
                    </p> 
                    <p class="lead"> <img src="http://i347.photobucket.com/albums/p466/sageschmied/media-20170413_zpsibkcdnrn.png"/></p>
<p class="lead">Dating clam gardens is important because it allows researchers to theorize about when wall construction began and how construction methods have developed over time. For communities, having tangible ages associated with clam gardens located in their territory is a way of expressing the longevity of their relationship to their territory, which can in turn be used as evidence in land claims processes. However, for many Indigenous communities, dating a clam garden does provide them with new information about their traditional practices and continued use of the land. While dating provides a new way for researchers to understand clam gardens, it is unfortunate that scientific evidence is ‘required’ in order for Indigenous histories and traditions to be recognized and validated. Further, one has to question what a “western”, empirical date really has to provide to the archaeological interpretation of a site. Would clam gardens then be interpreted as a new driver, responsible for the progression of social complexity? Regardless of the age of a clam garden, it is important to keep in mind that the result is still an anthropogenic environment and we do not necessarily need to know when those environmental changes began in order to understand what clam gardens are and how Indigenous peoples interact and relate to them. In some cases, dating may only benefit outside perspectives, such as those of archaeologists and other researchers, in understanding land use and settlement of the Northwest coast.
