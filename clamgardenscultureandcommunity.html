                    <h2>Community</h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        <img src="http://i347.photobucket.com/albums/p466/sageschmied/media-20170413_zpsdmfcj2sw.jpg"/> </p> <p class="lead"> With knowledge of the rich and productive beaches of the past, some Indigenous peoples view the unharvested clam flats of today as unhealthy, dead, or dying, because they have not been maintained as they were in the past. Regular clam digging ensured that beaches were kept clear and aerated, resulting in a productive clam habitat. Today, many beaches are covered with layers of sea lettuce, filled with an abundance of dead bivalves and are affected by pollution, all of which decrease the clam flat’s productivity.

In Canada, clam gardens may have a role to play in Indigenous peoples’ sovereign expressions in land claims processes. Originally, Nations seeking treaties were only able to claim land up to the high tide mark. Everything below that on the beach, including the intertidal, is considered federal land and is therefore non-negotiable space. However, under English Common Law, which is the basis of Canadian Law, a man-made wall is an indication of property. Clam gardens indicate occupation and use of space, in addition to embodying traditional subsistence practices within a specific area and are therefore an indication of multiple Aboriginal rights. 
<p/>
<p class="lead">Almost all of the shellfish harvested in British Columbia is exported. There are currently 40 registered commercial intertidal clam growers in British Columbia today. In 2010, approximately 2,200 tonnes of clams were commercially harvested in the province, with a total farmgate value of $8.1 million. Commercial clamming in British Columbia began in the 1920’s, peaked in the 1960’s and finally collapsed in 1985 due to complications with red tide and the preference for other species such as littleneck and manila clams. The Pacific clamming industry suffered a similar fate for Americans when the market collapsed in the 1960’s after a large earthquake destroyed nearly all of the existing clam processing factories. Despite the arrival of a non-Indigenous clam industries, Indigenous peoples continued to play an active role in clam harvesting by continuing practices of clam gardening and participating in commercial enterprises. Today, St. Jean’s Cannery is the only remaining butter clam cannery in British Columbia and has recently partnered with the NCN Cannery Corporation, whom represents six Nuu-chah-nulth nations.

                    <p class="lead">Restoration and renewed use of clam gardens has the potential to provide positive outcomes for Indigenous communities. For example, traditional cultivation and harvesting practices could be passed down from elders, along with other teachings, to younger community members. It would also situate Indigenous peoples on the landscape within their territory, allowing for place based learning to occur, while strengthening the community’s relationship to the land. Clam gardening could be considered a return to subsistence living, bringing economic advantages to community members.

                    <p class="lead"> Below are some examples of community engagement with clam gardens:
In 2014, the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve, located in the Strait of Georgia, began working alongside the Hul’q’umi’num and WSANEC First Nations to restore two clam gardens in the park. Stones within the rock walls were replaced in order to re-create optimal growing habitats for the clams. The $900,000, five-year project is guided by local elders, many of whom have memories of maintaining the gardens as young children under the direction of their parents and grandparents. Through the restoration process, Coast Salish elders are sharing knowledge and stories about their culture with their community and other interested individuals. Place-based learning situates and regrounds community members on the land. Restoration also allows scientists to monitor the effects of a modified environment on clams.
                    </p> <p class="lead"> <img src="http://i347.photobucket.com/albums/p466/sageschmied/media-20170413_zpso5xenkan.jpg"/></p>
                    <p class="lead"> In 2006, the governments of Canada and British Columbia signed an historic agreement with the Maa-nulth First Nations, a Treaty Society of Nuu-chah-nulth Nations on the west coast of Vancouver Island. In accordance with the agreement, some sites in Bamfield and Kyuquot Sound have restricted shellfish harvesting to Maa-nulth Treaty members only. Under these conditions, clam gardens located in the area could easily be restored and used by community members.  </p>

                    <p class="lead"> Clam gardens have always been venues of knowledge transmission and they continue to act as such as they are engaged by community members as well as archaeologists and other researchers. Historical perspectives on the ecological management of intertidal ecosystems would have benefits for modern clam industries. Understanding historical food security and sustainability would have additional benefits for today’s society. Beyond catalyzing cultural resurgence, understanding the function and meaning of clam gardens would provide tangible demonstrations of key aspects of Indigenous worldviews to non-Indigenous communities.
                    </p> <p class="lead">
Research along the central and northern coast of British Columbia has demonstrated that each community had a distinct method for harvesting, preparing, and storing clams from clam gardens. These were based on each group’s individual interpretations of what a given species meant to their people and was codified in distinct oral stories associated with each species. By considering personal accounts from local Indigenous peoples, archaeologists can generate better interpretations of clam gardens with context provided by those communities and individuals who built and used them. In addition, locating and identifying clam gardens can provide insight into sea level changes along the Northwest Coast. Clam gardens could help inform the abundance of data presented by shell midden deposits along the coast, potentially linking a clam garden feature to a particular village site.

                    <h2> Colonialism</h2>
                    <p class="lead"> It is important to remember that clam gardens are not being “discovered” by archaeologists and other researchers, but rather, acknowledged. Clam gardens have existed since time immemorial  and have remained in the conscience minds of Indigenous communities for equally as long. Although they clam gardens may not be as actively interacted with as they once had, clam gardening should be viewed as an ongoing practice of Indigenous cultures along the Northwest Coast. 

                     </p> <p class="lead">-The lack of clam garden awareness reflects colonial perceptions of Indigenous culture and traditions. Much like a fence, clam gardens clearly delineate occupied space, however, colonial frameworks neatly ignore this highly sophisticated form of mariculture. A similar example of colonial myopia is the cultivation of camas among Coast Salish peoples. Camas was a staple food crop for many communities and was harvested in carefully cultivated fields. The area known as Beacon Hill Park in present day Victoria, British Columbia was seen by the first European colonizers as a ‘natural park’, due to its abundance of open meadows. However, the ‘park’ was in fact a vast camas garden that had been cleared, maintained and cultivated by Lekwungen peoples for thousands of years. The camas meadows did not remotely resemble European modes of farming and with the help of the settlers’ colonial standards of agriculture, the camas meadows were considered to be unoccupied spaces. Subsequently, the settlers’ livestock were put out to pasture in the meadows, devastating the camas plants. The continued use of the space as a park remains a point of contention for the Lekwungen.

Colonial projects, such as the Indian Residential School System, took a direct toll on clam gardening traditions. Kwakwaka’wakw Clan Chief Kwaxistalla Adam Dick describes how as a child in the 1930’s he was hidden by his parents from the police who had come to take children away to residential school. By remaining with his family and community, Kwaxistalla received intense instruction on food harvesting and management, including the construction and maintenance of clam gardens. In addition to the knowledge that he can provide to his community and younger generations, Kwaxistalla has been a key knowledge holder and consultant for those researching clam gardens. As an institution, the residential school system prevented the onward transmission of cultural knowledge to both the generations that attended the schools as well as well as generations of descendents.

                    <p class="lead">It should be noted that many resurgence and revitalization efforts surrounding clam gardens are instigated within a colonial framework. An example of this is the Clam Garden Restoration Project happening in the traditional territories of the Hul’q’umi’num and WSÁNEĆ Nations in the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve. Although members of the two Nations are seen as leaders in the project, Parks Canada is the federal governing body that holds the final say. Institutions such as Royal Roads University, Simon Fraser University and the University of Saskatchewan are additional partners in the project, introducing further colonial structures to the initiative. The project itself has many positive outcomes for both the Hul’q’umi’num and the WSÁNEĆ, however, the project is not without colonial and political influences.
