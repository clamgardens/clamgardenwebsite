                    <h2> What is a clam garden? </h2>
                    <p class="lead">
A clam garden, or rock wall terrace, is one form of intertidal resource management employed by Indigenous peoples on the Northwest Coast. It is a way of managing a defined space in the nearshore marine environment in order to increase the abundance of marine bivalves (e.g. clams). Specifically, clam gardens are man made features that alter the beach’s topography in order to increase shellfish productivity.

Clam gardens were unknown to scientists, archaeologists and non-Indigenous people in general until a geomorphologist named John Harper observed intertidal wall features while doing aerial surveys in 1996. Unable to identify these intertidal walls geologically, Harper understood that they must have been built by humans. Around the same time, the existence of clam gardens was brought to the attention of Judith Williams, a visual arts scholar, by a Klahoose elder. The lack of awareness surrounding clam gardens is remarkable considering Indigenous people’s relationships to, use, and knowledge of clam gardens that not only stems from deep relationships with the land, but branches into the present day.

A clam garden is created first by clearing the surface of a beach of large rocks and debris. Next, a rock wall of boulders is built between two points, such as the edges of a cove, at the zero tide line. Based on their excavations, Lepofsky et al. determined that in some cases rock walls were constructed in a single event, whereas in otherss, walls were built up over time. As the tides deposit new sediments on the landward side of the wall, the natural slope of the beach is widened and leveled. In some cases, the newly created terrace surface is supplemented with shell hash as infill. To ensure productivity once constructed, clam gardens were maintained by keeping the clam flat clear of debris, fertilizing with shell hash, aerating or tilling the sediment, as well as the culling of larger older shellfish to create more space for juvenile clams to grow.</p> <p class="lead"> <img src="http://i347.photobucket.com/albums/p466/sageschmied/media-20170412_zpshwxtewc3.png"/>	</p>

For example, on Quadra Island one clam garden was noted by Lepofsky et al. as having been built in an area that, based on the natural topography of the location (i.e. bedrock shelf), did not have a natural or suitable clam habitat prior to the construction of the garden. That is to say that the construction of a clam garden can not only enhance an existing clam beach, but create shellfish habitat where one did not exist previously.

The deciding factor in the suitability of a clam garden in a given coastal setting is environmental context. Broadly speaking, the oceanic conditions along the Northwest Coast are roughly similar in terms of temperature and nutrient content. This is an important as oceanic temperature is an important variable in the ability of a shellfish species to survive and prosper. For this reason, we are unlikely to find similar clam gardening traditions in, say, southern California, where species such as butter clams are unable to survive. As noted earlier, in the right oceanic conditions, a clam garden can be constructed to enhance existing clam flats or create entirely new habitats. Clam gardens tend to be constructed along the sides of semi-protected inlets with strong tidal currents and away from freshwater sources.

                    <p class="lead">
	Clam gardens can host a variety of shellfish species, depending on the soil types present on the beach. Butter clams are noted as the most abundant species in clam gardens, due in part to the fact that they are capable of living in conditions ranging from pure sand to pure gravel. In addition, butter clams are particularly attractive for harvesting as they do not burrow nearly as deep as some other species. One research project on Quadra Island found there to be four times as many butter clams in clam gardened beaches relative to non-walled beaches. Littleneck, horse and macoma clams as well as heart cockles are additional species that are commonly found in clam gardens. The wall itself creates an additional reef habitat for species such as octopus and mussels that would not otherwise be found in the intertidal zone.  Hemlock boughs were hung from the wall, creating a place for herring to spawn their eggs. Beyond shellfish, clam gardens served additional roles in terms of community and culture. The wall was a place where community members could come together to sit and fish, not to mention that it took a community effort to maintain the garden itself.

                    <p class="lead">The Northwest Coast can be defined as the region extending from southeast Alaska, through British Columbia, Washington and Oregon to Northern California. There are many Indigenous groups and cultures that live within this region that are coined under the term ‘Northwest Coast Cultures’. It is important to note that although groups along the Northwest Coast occupy similar environments and may share other similarities, they remain both politically and culturally distinct from one another. Many Northwest Coast groups with access to the coast engaged and and continue to engage in clam gardening, in addition to other forms of resource management. Unfortunately, shellfish and shellfish resource management strategies have been greatly overlooked by archaeologists, anthropologists and scientists up until very recently.  For example, as far as we know there is only one example of clam gardening recorded in the ethnographic record  from Orcas Island (Lummi Territory) in the Salish Sea area in the 1920’s. Clam gardens were essential to the food security and stability of many coastal communities. Among the Kwakwaka’wakw of northeastern Vancouver Island, for example, oral histories passed down generation to generation describe various methods of harvesting clams, creating clam gardens and cooking and eating clams. Traditional ecological knowledge associated with clam gardens is often recognized for its potential to contribute to modern resource management. However, it is important to note that traditional ecological knowledge is Indigenous knowledge and not a subset thereof, as Indigenous knowledge cannot be compartmentalized. That is to say that clam gardens are more than just a form of resource management; they exemplify Indigenous relationships with the land and reflect important components of Indigenous worldviews. 	</p>

In addition, clams are easy to harvest, with a single harvest potentially yielding a substantial quantity of food with relatively little effort. Clams and other shellfish species have various uses beyond food consumption. Shells were used as building materials, tools, dishes, for decoration in regalia and many other purposes. In addition, clams hold spiritual importance to many coastal peoples, as is exemplified by the Haida origin story,

                    <h2>Ancient Shellfish Mariculture on the Northwest Coast of North America- Lepofsky et al. </h2>
                  
                    <p class="lead">To begin, Lepofsky and her team used First Nations linguistic data, oral traditions and memories, geomorphological surveys, archaeological techniques and ecological experiments to locate clam gardens along the coast of British Columbia. Through this research, they found that First Nations along the Northwest Coast had specific language to describe how clam gardens were built. Specific beaches were selected as ideal locations and the walls were intentionally constructed.
			</p>
<p class="lead"> The researchers surveyed four regions that included eleven clam garden sites. Their observations indicated a wide variation in the clam garden site locations and formations. Most often the rock walls were located along the sides of semi-protected inlets with strong tidal currents, allowing the gardens to be well flushed. Gardens were identified on both large and small beaches. The surveys also revealed that some walls were not built of rock but instead the natural bedrock shelf of the beach was used as a wall. The walls were built at specific tidal elevations on the beach in order to maximize the optimal clam habitat.       
  <img src="http://i347.photobucket.com/albums/p466/sageschmied/media-20170414_zpslazxbph2.png"/>	</p>
			<p class="lead">As there has been little research done on clam gardens to date, Lepofsky et al. had to develop new strategies to employ radiocarbon datings. Using the four regions previously surveyed, the team excavated trenches within six terraced gardens using two techniques: excavating the landward side of the wall and excavating within the wall itself. By sampling and dating organic materials such as clam shells and barnacle scars, these two excavation strategies provided maximum to minimum age ranges for the construction of the rock wall features.
</p>
			<p class="lead"> These tests, which were the first radiocarbon dates recorded for clam gardens on the coast, yielded a date range of approximately 1700 - 200 years old. The excavations also provide details on wall construction and the placement of walls helps researchers study sea level change. The rock walls were constructed at specific tidal heights to maximize clam productivity. 

			</p> <p class="lead"> The researchers concluded that clam gardens clearly challenge the outdated Anthrpological notion that First Nations of the Northwest Coast were simple hunter-gatherers living in 'wild' landscapes. It expands archaeologists’ understanding of how Indigenous peoples along the coast interacted with their land and seascapes. This food management system not only nourished densely populated Indigenous communities on the Northwest Coast for millennia, but contributed to and informed traditional systems of governance and relationships to the land that continue today.
